# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `DashboardNav`'s account-menu avatar now renders the vendor's uploaded
  profile icon (`AvatarImage`, sourced from `dashboard/layout.tsx` reading
  `user.user_metadata.avatar_url`) instead of always showing initials —
  the upload flow shipped without ever wiring the result up anywhere.
  Also fixed the dropdown's vendor-name label, which rendered as tiny
  muted text instead of a bold name + "Vendor account" subtitle.
- Profile page's social-links inputs now show real brand icons
  (Instagram/Facebook/TikTok via `@icons-pack/react-simple-icons`, a
  generic globe for website) with proper labels, via a new
  `SocialLinksFields` component — previously plain unlabeled inputs with
  the field key as a placeholder.
- `FeedbackForm`'s NPS/category pickers and `SupportForm`'s category picker
  now use shadcn `ToggleGroup`/`Textarea` instead of hand-rolled radio
  markup and a plain `<textarea>`, matching qkit's equivalent components.
  No behavior, copy, or schema change.
- `/dashboard/profile` now covers the full profile-settings standard
  (`docs/business/2026-07-21-profile-settings-page-standard.md`): display
  name, profile icon (upload to a new `vendor-avatars` Storage bucket), and
  change-password sections, alongside the existing stall name/social links.
  Previously only stall name and social links existed on this page.
- Bumped `next` from `^16.2.9` to `^16.2.11`, patching four high-severity
  advisories (SSRF in Server Actions on custom servers, SSRF via
  attacker-controlled rewrite destination hostname) flagged by the CI
  dependency-audit gate.
- `SiteFooter` now renders the full mandatory footer per
  `docs/business/2026-07-21-landing-page-standard.md` §1.5: a `StockKit`
  wordmark (linking `/#top`) and a one-line tagline, alongside the existing
  `© <year> stockkit · a Merqo kit` credit line — it previously carried only
  the credit line, matching qkit's and loopkit's footer structure.
- Logo mark (`BrandText`, public `Navbar`, `DashboardNav`) now renders
  "StockKit" (PascalCase) instead of "stockkit" (fully lowercase), matching
  the locked cross-kit brand-naming convention. Public `Navbar` gained the
  required `#faq` link and its wordmark now uses a plain `<a href="/#top">`
  instead of `next/link`'s `Link`, matching the locked landing-page
  standard. Favicon's brand color updated to match the current (richer)
  primary — it was still the pre-refresh washed-out hex.
- Landing page visual refresh: a new `Space Grotesk` display typeface on
  every section heading, an ambient cobalt-tinted background, a `LedgerCardPreview`
  hero illustration (mock product card — on-hand count, unit cost, a recent
  stock movement), icons and `01/02/03` numbering on `HowItWorks`, icons on
  `Benefits`, a restrained `fade-rise` entrance animation, and a navbar
  restyle (floating pill → full-width sticky translucent bar).

- Landing page decomposed into section components (`Hero`, `HowItWorks`,
  `Benefits`, `Faq`, `Cta`) matching the sibling kits' structure, adding a
  "why vendors pick stockkit" Benefits section stockkit didn't have before.
- Login gained Google OAuth sign-in and a full forgot-password/reset-password
  flow, via a new `/auth/callback` route — none of this existed previously.
- Login and reset-password restyled with a new `ElevatedCard` component.
- Primary color raised from a washed-out `oklch(0.45 0.09 250)` to a
  contrast-verified richer `oklch(0.46 0.16 255)` (light) /
  `oklch(0.68 0.13 252)` (dark); fixed a dead gradient utility that had three
  identical color stops.
- Public `Navbar`/`SiteFooter` made session-aware server components.
