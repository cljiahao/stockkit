# src/lib

Shared utilities and business logic. `schemas.ts` — Zod schemas for forms
and server actions; `types.ts` — hand-maintained DB types mirroring
`supabase/migrations/`; `stock.ts` — stock-status (ok/low/out)
classification; `action-result.ts` — `ActionResult<T>` server-action
return type; `merqo-vendor-feedback.ts` — `submitVendorFeedback`:
hand-written mirror of merqo's cross-schema `submit_vendor_feedback` RPC
contract, generic over the caller's own `Database`/schema; `supabase/` —
browser/server/service clients.

`brand-icon.tsx` — the `brandIcon(size)` generator consumed by
`src/app/icon.tsx`/`apple-icon.tsx`, per
`docs/business/2026-07-21-brand-icon-family-standard.md`'s shared
formula. `BRAND_STEEL`/`BRAND_PALE` are concrete-hex approximations of
`--primary`/`--primary-foreground` — keep in sync if those tokens change.

`image-resize.ts` — `resizeToWebp(file, maxDim, quality?)`, browser-only
(Canvas + `createImageBitmap`): resizes an uploaded image so its longest
side is `<= maxDim` and re-encodes it as WebP, falling back to the original
file untouched if the browser can't decode/encode it. Used by
`src/components/image-uploader.tsx` before every avatar upload.
